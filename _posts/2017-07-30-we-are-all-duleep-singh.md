# We are all Dalip Singh
### Why the movie Black Prince resonates so much with global Punjabi men



On October 25, 1887 on a drizzly British morning, *The Standard* newspaper carried a letter ending with a customary salutation "*your obedient servant*" from someone who signed it as *"Sovereign of the Sikh nation, and Implacable Foe of England."* Duleep Singh, the son of the last Maharaja of Punjab, Ranjit Singh, had written this letter from Hotel Billo in Moscow on October 18. Like many Sikhs of my generation, Duleep was a man of contradictions - fighting hard to balance between his nurtured environment and his heart's call to connect with his roots.

I became interested in the Sikh history of eighteenth century after embracing my roots and Sikh identity once completely abandoning it, just like Duleep. I have written about that journey of loosing and finding back my faith not on the banks of Satluj, but of Mississippi.[^[The Turban in the Obama McCain Debate](http://sikhchic.com/people/the_turban_in_the_obama_mccain_debate).] My newfound love for the turban - I at one time had about 70+ turbans in my collection - lead to few years later to [launch TheTurbanClub while attending a summer at Yale Business School](http://som.yale.edu/blog/2015/07/takeaways-global-pre-mba-leadership-program), and decided to publish how the men in turban were perceived in the west a century ago. It lead me to the letter mentioned above, among other gems about Sikhs.

> At the present moment when the Tower guns have pealed forth their thunder in commemoration of the magnitude and importance of the late sanguinary victory in India, it may not be either inappropriate or uninteresting to our readers ─many of whom are, no doubt, personally interested in this subject─ to give a slight sketch of the military usages, manners, and character of the great warriors of the East, the Sikhs, who consider the profession of arms the religious duty of every individual.

> The Government of the Sikhs, considered in its theory, may be termed a theocracy. They obey a temporal chief, it is true, but that chief possesses his power and authority by professing himself the servant of the Káhlsá, a Government which can only be said to act in times of great public emergency, through the means of a great national council, of which any chief is a member, and which is supposed to deliberate and resolve under the immediate inspiration and impulse of an invisible being, who they believe always watches over the interest of the commonweal.

> When a Gúrú-mátá, a great national council, is called, as it always is when any imminent danger threatens the country, or any large expedition is to be undertaken, all the Sikh chiefs assemble at Amrichsas. The assembly, which is called the Gúrú-mátá, is convened by the Acales, or immortals (a body who under the double character of priests and desperate soldiers have usurped the sole direction of all religious affairs), and when the chiefs meet on this occasion it is concluded that all private animosities cease, and that every man sacrifices his personal feelings at the shrine of the general good, and, actuated by principles of pure patriotism, thinks of nothing but the interest of the religion and common wealth  to which he belongs.

> When the chiefs and principal leaders are seated, the Adi Grant’h and Dalama Padshah Ka Grant’h are placed before them. They all bend their hands before the Scriptures and exclaim, “Wa! Gúrúji Ki Fatch.”  A great quantity of cakes, made of wheat, butter, and sugar, are then placed before the volumes of the Sacred Writings, and covered with a cloth. These holy cakes, which are, in commemoration of the injunction of Navac, to eat, and give others to eat, next receive the salutation of the assembly, who then rise, and the Arabs pray aloud, while the musicians play. The Acales, when the prayers are finished, desire the council to be seated. They sit down, and the cakes being uncovered, are eaten by all classes of Sikhs. The Acales then exclaim, “Sirdirs (chiefs), this is a Gúrú-mátá,” on which prayers are again said aloud. The chiefs after this sit closer, and say to each other, “This sacred Grant’h, is betwixt us, let us swear by our Scriptures to forget all internal disputes and to be united.” This moment of religious fervour and ardent patriotism is taken to reconcile all animosities. They then proceed to consider the danger with which they are threatened, to settle the best plans for adverting it, and to choose the generals who are to lead their Dal-Khalsa, or army of the State, against the common enemy.

> The principal chiefs of the Sikhs are all descended from Hindoo tribes. The lower classes are protected from tyranny and violence by the precepts of their common religion, and by the condition of their country, which enables them to abandon, whenever they choose, a leader whom they dislike; and the distance of a few miles places them under the protection of his rival or enemy. It is from this cause that the lowest Sikh horseman usually assumes a very independent style, and the highest chief treats his military followers with attention and conciliation.

> The character of the Sikhs, or rather Sinhs ─which is the name by which the followers of Gúrú-Govind,, who are all devoted to arms, is distinguished─ is very marked. They have in general, the Hindoo cast of countenance, somewhat altered by their long beards, and are quite as active as the Mahratas, and much more robust, from their living fuller, and enjoying a better and colder climate. Their courage, which is equal to all times to that of any native of India, when wrought upon by prejudice or religion, is quite desperate.

The Sikh nation, who have throughout their early history always appear, like a suppressed flame, to rise into higher splendour from every attempt to crush them, become, while they are oppressed, as formidable for their union as for their determined valour and unconquerable spirit of resistance; but a state of persecution and distress is the one most favourable for the action of a constitution like theirs. They are all horsemen, and have no infantry in their own country, except for the defence of their forts and villages, though they generally serve as infantry in foreign armies. They use swords, spears, matchlocks, and bows and arrows. They are bold and rather rough in their address, which appears more conspicuous to a stranger from their invariably speaking in a loud tone of voice. Talking aloud is so habitual to a Sikh, that he bawls a secret in your ear.

The Sikh soldier is generally speaking, brave, active, and cheerful, without polish, but neither destitute of sincerity or attachment, and if he often appears wanting in humanity, it is not so much to be attributed to his national character, as to the habits of a life which, from the condition of the society in which he is born, is generally passed in scenes of violence and rapine.
It would be difficult, if not impracticable, to ascertain the number of armies which the Sikhs could bring into action. They boast that they could raise more than a hundred thousand horse, and if it were possible to assemble every horseman, the statement might not be an exaggeration.

Flipping through European English newspapers between 1800 and 1900, there lies a trove of information.

The more one digs that information that young Punjabi men have surprising kept away from is both a story of inspiration as well that of heart breaks. Commonly known as Lion of Punjab, the only Maharaja of Punjab - ruled under the name of Khalsa. Khalsa is a egalitarian order of Sikhs - baptized by the tenth Guru of Sikhs with commitment to aspire for higher calls of life - justice for all, while emphasizing the core tenets of first Guru - remembering the creator, hard work and sharing. Formation of Khalsa re-emphasized the ideas of sovereignty seeded by the sixth teacher - Guru Hargobind, going as far as including the idea in the everyday salutation - Waheguru Jee Ka Khalsa, Waheguru Jee Kee Fateh (Khalsa belongs only to the Creator, and to Creator alone belongs victory/destiny/end).

The most part of 20th century, Punjabis lived in a veil of cloud. The Punjabi identity merged with Indian/Pakistani national identity - leading to one of the largest mass migration. Partition of Punjabi displaced fifteen million people and killed more than a million. 60's and 70's was a struggling period for linguistic based state, which further carved the eastern Punjab to a much smaller area. 80's and 90's was the period of Sikh, feeling cornered and cheated, rose up against the state, which was crushed with an iron fist costing another tens of thousands Punjabi lives. In the words of historian Ajay Bhardwaj, 'Punjabis did not get the time to pause and reflect on the loss.'

But as Bob Dylan once sand, the the times are a changing. The generation of Sikhs have grown up in Punjab, in Canada, US, Europe and elsewhere, and have just started to debate the Sikh and Punjabi history written for them - separating grain from the chaff.

The Black Prince is one such amazing effort, where the team toiled hard to do justice to a complex story - the human Duleep with his habits and vices, and the Sikh Duleep that aspired for something larger than himself, something other than he had known all his life growing up.

For many such Duleep of my era - sitting in far away lands - probably leading a more comfortable life, our heart long for the sprawling fields left behind, of monthly homages paid at Darbar Sahib, Amritsar. The urge to identify with Lahore, as much as with Amritsar is becoming evident in arts and theatre - success of movie Lahoriye that transcends Punjab beyond Indian and Pakistani borders is a proof of that.

And living in this alternate reality in the west, we long and mourn for the lost forts of Anandpur to whitewashed buildings, we mourn the slow poisoning of a language and a culture under the urge for nationalistic hegemony, we mourn the partition of the home of nation of people that aspired to bring the best of the three faiths together. The foundation stone of Punjab's one of the holiest place, Darbar Sahib, a gurduara wrongly referred to as Golden Temple,  was laid down by a Muslim faqir, Sain Mian Mir of Lahore. Ninth Guru or teacher of Sikhs were persecuted defending the rights of Hindus of Kashmir to freely exercise their religion, despite himself not being a follower of it.

When Ranjit Singh formed the largest empire under the banner of Sarkar-i-Khalsa or Pañjab, he ruled as a secular king. His ministers were from all faiths, his armies had soldiers from as far as France and USA.  And yet, when the two larger nations formed their own countries when British left post second world war, the land of Punjab was dissected right in the middle. With both India and Pakistan going far right, my generation of Punjabis that I have met across the globe feel this sense of loss.

My generation of Sikhs born after the Battle of Amritsar have had a hard time figuring out what our culture represents. The caretakers of the gurdwaras elected and governing on the whims of the state had their own agenda definitions - Sikh the hyper-masculine warrior; the agricultural needs of the state promoted it as the proud landlord small lands; the need of Sikh men in wars of 60's and 70's promoted Sikhs as the warrior race; Bollywood persistently pushed the turban less, drunks - both strong vices in the faith.

Yet no one in my youth talked about the letters of paternal and devotional love written by Guru Arjan to his father Guru Ram Das in Shabad Hazare, of egalitarian feminism by Bhai Gurdas and Guru Nanak himself, of Puran Singh - the poet lover of Punjab, whose love of Japanese culture in 19th century was as beautiful as his longing for his home; of Teja Singh & Kartar Singh Sarabha - who left Harvard and Berkley to serve the causes of their own people and Dalip Singh - a young kid taken away from home, grew without any nurturing of his culture that he spent later part trying hard to identify with.

The Black Prince is hopefully a beginning of the narration of uncovering of our past, and a beginning of the discourse for what the future of Punjab for the next few centuries.
