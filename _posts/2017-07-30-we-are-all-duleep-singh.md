On October 25, 1887 on a drizzly British morning, *The Standard* newspaper carried a letter ending with a customary salutation "*your obedient servant*" from someone who signed it as *"Sovereign of the Sikh nation, and Implacable Foe of England."* Duleep Singh, the son of the last Maharaja of Punjab, Ranjit Singh, had written this letter from Hotel Billo in Moscow on October 18. Like many Sikhs of my generation, Duleep was a man of contradictions - fighting hard to balance between his nurtured environment and his heart's call to connect with his roots.

I became interested in the Sikh history of eighteenth century after embracing my roots and Sikh identity once completely abandoning it, just like Duleep. I have written about that journey of loosing and finding back my faith not on the banks of Satluj, but of Mississippi.[^[The Turban in the Obama McCain Debate](http://sikhchic.com/people/the_turban_in_the_obama_mccain_debate).] My newfound love for the turban - I at one time had about 70+ turbans in my collection - lead to few years later to [launch TheTurbanClub while attending a summer at Yale Business School](http://som.yale.edu/blog/2015/07/takeaways-global-pre-mba-leadership-program), and decided to publish how the men in turban were perceived in the west a century ago. It lead me to the letter mentioned above, among other gems about Sikhs.

Flipping through European English newspapers between 1800 and 1900, there lies a trove of information.

The more one digs that information that young Punjabi men have surprising kept away from is both a story of inspiration as well that of heart breaks. Commonly known as Lion of Punjab, the only Maharaja of Punjab - ruled under the name of Khalsa. Khalsa is a egalitarian order of Sikhs - baptized by the tenth Guru of Sikhs with commitment to aspire for higher calls of life - justice for all, while emphasizing the core tenets of first Guru - remembering the creator, hard work and sharing. Formation of Khalsa re-emphasized the ideas of sovereignty seeded by the sixth teacher - Guru Hargobind, going as far as including the idea in the everyday salutation - *Waheguru Jee Ka Khalsa, Waheguru Jee Kee Fateh* (Khalsa belongs only to the Creator, and to Creator alone belongs victory/destiny/end).

The most part of 20th century, Punjabis lived in a veil of cloud. The Punjabi identity merged with Indian/Pakistani national identity - leading to one of the largest mass migration. Partition of Punjabi displaced fifteen million people and killed more than a million. 60's and 70's was a struggling period for linguistic based state, which further carved the eastern Punjab to a much smaller area. 80's and 90's was the period of Sikh, feeling cornered and cheated, rose up against the state, which was crushed with an iron fist costing another tens of thousands Punjabi lives. In the words of historian Ajay Bhardwaj, 'Punjabis never got the time to pause and reflect on the loss.'

> Given the fact the pre-partition Punjab had a robust legacy of ‘live and let live’ tradition bequeathed by the efforts of Muslim Sufis, Hindu Sants and Sikh Gurus, such an outcome at the end of 1947 was too drastic and traumatic remained an intriguing and perplexing puzzle. There were some peculiarities which rendered the Punjab vulnerable to violence in case the competing parties and their leaders could not agree to keep their province united. Among them the main factor was that nearly a million Punjabi Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs had recently been demobilized from the British Indian Army.  Additionally there were criminal gangs operating all over Punjab. These two elements and partisan government functionaries, politicians and ethnic activists formed nexuses that began to coordinate attacks on the ‘enemy community’.  Once the British were gone and two partisan administrations came to power in the divided Punjab whole-sale attacks on the minorities started taking place. By the end of the year ethnic cleansing had been achieved.

But as Bob Dylan once sand, the the times are a changing. The generation of Sikhs have grown up in Punjab, in Canada, US, Europe and elsewhere, and have just started to debate the Sikh and Punjabi history written for them - separating grain from the chaff.

The Black Prince is one such amazing effort, where the team toiled hard to do justice to a complex story - the human Duleep with his habits and vices, and the Sikh Duleep that aspired for something larger than himself, something other than he had known all his life growing up.

For many such Duleep of my era - sitting in far away lands - probably leading a more comfortable life, our heart long for the sprawling fields left behind, of monthly homages paid at Darbar Sahib, Amritsar. The urge to identify with Lahore, as much as with Amritsar is becoming evident in arts and theatre - success of movie Lahoriye that transcends Punjab beyond Indian and Pakistani borders is a proof of that.

And living in this alternate reality in the west, we long and mourn for the lost forts of Anandpur to whitewashed buildings, we mourn the slow poisoning of a language and a culture under the urge for nationalistic hegemony, we mourn the partition of the home of nation of people that aspired to bring the best of the three faiths together. The foundation stone of Punjab's one of the holiest place, Darbar Sahib, a gurduara wrongly referred to as Golden Temple,  was laid down by a Muslim faqir, Sain Mian Mir of Lahore. Ninth Guru or teacher of Sikhs were persecuted defending the rights of Hindus of Kashmir to freely exercise their religion, despite himself not being a follower of it.

When Ranjit Singh formed the largest empire under the banner of Sarkar-i-Khalsa or Pañjab, he ruled as a secular king. His ministers were from all faiths, his armies had soldiers from as far as France and USA.  And yet, when the two larger nations formed their own countries when British left post second world war, the land of Punjab was dissected right in the middle. With both India and Pakistan going far right, my generation of Punjabis that I have met across the globe feel this sense of loss.

My generation of Sikhs born after the Battle of Amritsar have had a hard time figuring out what our culture represents. The caretakers of the gurdwaras elected and governing on the whims of the state had their own agenda definitions - Sikh the hyper-masculine warrior; the agricultural needs of the state promoted it as the proud landlord small lands; the need of Sikh men in wars of 60's and 70's promoted Sikhs as the warrior race; Bollywood persistently pushed the turban less, drunks - both strong vices in the faith.

Yet no one in my youth talked about the letters of paternal and devotional love written by Guru Arjan to his father Guru Ram Das in Shabad Hazare, of egalitarian feminism by Bhai Gurdas and Guru Nanak himself, of Puran Singh - the poet lover of Punjab, whose love of Japanese culture in 19th century was as beautiful as his longing for his home; of Teja Singh & Kartar Singh Sarabha - who left Harvard and Berkley to serve the causes of their own people and Dalip Singh - a young kid taken away from home, grew without any nurturing of his culture that he spent later part trying hard to identify with.

The Black Prince is hopefully a beginning of the narration of uncovering of our past, and a beginning of the discourse for what the future of Punjab for the next few centuries.
